    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p> This is my very first assignment that I have created by myself, without any help from anyone. I hope it showcases what I can do and what I have learnt and how far I have come with my learning.I also do hope that by the end of my portfolio you willl be able to see how my development has progressed. This is going to be my Curriculum Vitae,in the form of a portfolio. </p>
        <p> As my projects increase, you will see developments and hopefully each project will be better than the other, My aim is for you to be able to see my capabilities and also my desire for not only web development but also to learn a new skill that I have no prior experience with.</p>
        <p> My wish more than anything is that you enjoy my work have a good experience going through my portfolio.</p>
